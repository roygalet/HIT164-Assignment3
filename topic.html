					Microinteraction
				</h3>
				<p>
					Glass augments microinteraction &#45; providing a maximum amount of utility for the minimum amount of user attention &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Starner">Starner</a> 2013&#41;&#46;
				</p>
				<p>
					&#34;Our goal is to reduce the time between intention and action&#34; &#45; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a>
				</p>
				<p>
				So Google designed Glass with&#58;
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>smartphone functions
					<li>integrate Google&#39;s services
					<li>gesture and voice recognition
					<li>ability to perform tasks instantaneously hands&#45;free
				</ul>
				<p>
					Taking photos&#44; just say &#34;OK Glass&#44; take a photo&#34;&#46;  If voice command isn&#39;t fast enough&#44; Glass Explorers will soon be receiving a software update which allows them to take a photo by just winking &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Briden">Briden</a> 2014&#41;&#46;
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="./references.html?id=#Starner">Starner</a> &#40;2013&#41; also added that when the time between intention and action becomes small enough&#44; the interface becomes an extension of the self&#46;

					Researchers at UC Berkeley have made home appliances to be controlled using Glass &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Briden">Briden</a> 2014&#41;&#46;
				</p>
				<p>
					A hospital in Boston has begun using Glass to scan <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> to help them keep track of patients
				</p>
				<p>
					In Texas&#44; a health care entrepreneur is working with anaesthesiologists to make their rounds safer and more efficient &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Della">Della Cava</a> 2014&#41;&#46;
				</p>
				<p>
					A programmer in Michigan is developing software that 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>monitor a driver&#39;s eyes
					<li>send visual and auditory alerts at signs of drowsiness
					<li>considering adding a gaming component to the app
					<li>would reward safe driving with points&#46;  
				</ul>			
				<p>
					A firefighter in North Carolina has been programming an app that
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>routes incoming 911 calls
					<li>brings information to the display
					<li>directions
					<li>hydrant locations
					<li>building blueprints
					<li>car diagrams

					The New York Police Department is also looking into Glass in order to see whether or not it would be a benefit to law enforcement officers working in the city &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Briden">Briden</a> 2014&#41;&#46;

				<p>
					Advantages&#58;
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>low power
					<li>low footprint
					<li>sits totally above the eyes
					<li>doesn&#39;t hinder vision
					<li>access information very quickly

					Ethics
				</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="./references.html?id=#Arthur">Arthur</a> &#40;2013&#41; considers Glass as a threat to privacy as Google is a company that has repeatedly breached the boundaries of what we think is &#34;private&#34;&#46;  
				</p>
				<p>
					The most important question according to <a href="./references.html?id=#Arthur">Arthur</a> &#40;2013&#41; is &#45; who owns and what happens to all of Glass&#39; data&#46;
				</p>
				<p>
					Google has teams of people who develop algorithms
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to locate where a device&#39;s owner is&#44; 
					<li>and what their past activity and searches are&#44; 
					<li>so Google will probably know what the owners are going to do &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Arthur">Arthur</a> 2013&#41;&#46;
				</ul>
				<p>
					<a href="./references.html?id=#Arthur">Arthur</a> &#40;2013&#41; also compared millions of Glass owners to CCTV cameras and Google is the monitor&#46;

					A Glass&#45;hole refers to a person who is hooked up excessively to Glass ignoring everything around&#46;  To combat stereotyping&#44; Google has revealed its own Top 10 Google Glass Myths &#40;<a href="./references.html?id=#Briden">Briden</a> 2014&#41;&#46;  This list includes reminders like&#44;
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					&#34;The Glass camera function is no different from a cell phone so behave as you would with your phone and ask permission before taking photos or videos of others&#46;&#34;
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					<a href="./references.html?id=#Explorer">Glass Explorer Community</a> &#40;2014&#41; posted in their website&#44;
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#34;In places where cell phone cameras aren&#39;t allowed&#44; the same rules will apply to Glass&#46; If you&#39;re asked to turn your phone off&#44; turn Glass off as well&#46; Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers&#46;”
